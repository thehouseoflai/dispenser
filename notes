Rebuilding after the loss of my previous laptop.


MQTT protocol:
dispenser/ping: sent every 5 seconds when a device is connected.
dispenser/$id/received: sent after receiving an RFID string.
dispenser/$id: for sending commands to the device. It understands:
  rfid_disable
  rfid_enable

rfid_enable pulls down the /ENABLE pin, and is supposed to switch the UART
to the "alternate" RX pin (GPIO13 = D7). It then does detect the tag, but
it sends me a bunch of garbage characters. Wrong port speed? Yep.

It also seems to lag after detecting? Several detections in a row and the
thing stops pinging completely. So, how about we introduce a timeout?
